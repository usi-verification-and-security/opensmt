### 2.1.0 (2021-08-16)

API changes:

 - Single `Logic` can now be used by multiple `MainSolver`s.
 - `MainSolver`, when provied with a `Logic`, is now responsible for all
   other compenents in the solver.

   state using `MainSolver::getModel`. This model object can be queried for
   value of various terms.

   object that can be obtained from `MainSolver` using
   `MainSolver::getInterpolationContext`.
 - Methods for term rewriting has been moved to separate classes. This
   includes term substitution and rewriting of mod/div operations or
   distinct terms.

   this release, but is being currently developed in a different branch.
